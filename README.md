# Chemistry Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an interactive analysis of a chemistry dataset, examining student performance, exercise difficulty, time spent, and feedback impact.

## Overview

The analysis explores a comprehensive chemistry dataset containing student answers, scores, response times, and feedback for various chemistry exercises. The goal is to identify patterns in student performance and provide insights for improving chemistry education.

## Key Findings

- **Average score** across exercises is 60.98, with 55.12% of submissions achieving perfect scores
- **Significant variation in exercise difficulty**, with success rates ranging from 7% to 97%
- **Time spent on exercises** varies widely, with an average of 28.43 minutes per exercise
- **Feedback appears to be provided** primarily for incorrect answers or challenging exercises
- **Very weak correlation** between time spent and scores achieved (-0.0842)

## Interactive Dashboard

## Analysis Components

### 1. Student Performance Analysis

- Identification of top-performing students
- Analysis of success rates across different student groups
- Examination of time efficiency in relation to performance

### 2. Exercise Difficulty Analysis

- Ranking of exercises by difficulty level
- Identification of the most challenging concepts
- Analysis of success rates across different exercise types

### 3. Time Analysis

- Distribution of time spent on exercises
- Identification of most time-consuming exercises
- Analysis of the relationship between time spent and performance

### 4. Feedback Impact Assessment

- Analysis of exercises with and without feedback
- Comparison of performance with and without feedback
- Statistical significance testing of feedback effects

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. **For Instructors**:
   - Focus additional instructional resources on the most challenging topics
   - Consider introducing intermediate exercises to bridge difficulty gaps
   - Review time requirements for the most time-consuming exercises
   - Implement more proactive feedback mechanisms

2. **For Students**:
   - Pay special attention to concepts covered in challenging exercises
   - Focus on quality of engagement rather than quantity of time spent
   - Seek feedback proactively, not just when struggling

3. **For Curriculum Development**:
   - Analyze characteristics of exercises with high success rates
   - Consider breaking down complex exercises into smaller components
   - Develop a more balanced distribution of exercise difficulty
